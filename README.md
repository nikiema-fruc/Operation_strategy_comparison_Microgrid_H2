**ABSTRACT** â€“ Reaching the 100% REN is a real challenge for islanded microgrids which are usually equipped with diesel 
generators to ensure the reliability of the electricity supply. The introduction of long-term seasonal hydrogen energy storage, 
coupled with short-term battery storage, represents a solution to ensure the quality and reliability of supply, while limiting the 
cost of storage. In this paper, we focus on the sizing problem of these microgrids (with $H_2$), but also on the energy management 
strategy (EMS) to be applied in order to minimize costs and maximize quality of service. We compare the results of 2 different energy
management strategies.

### Energy Management Strategy compared

#### Strategy 1 : Battery priority
In this strategy, the battery will be primarily use to store the excessive energy , and to provide the energy to the grid when it will be needed . The Electrolyser and the fuel cell, will be use only , if the battery is not suffiscient (in term of power to store or provide) or empty.

#### Strategy 2 : hydrogen priority
This strategy will do the exact opposite of the strategy 1. It will prior the the electrolyser to transform the excessive

We determined wich strategy is better , and we also made a sensitivity analysis on the price of electrolyser and fuel cell prices.
